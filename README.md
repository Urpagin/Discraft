# Discraft
Playing Minecraft through Discord!

# The Original Idea

I wondered: would it be possible to play Minecraft through Discord? That would need some async knowledge, wouldn't it? And it's quite funny, right?

An original idea I tried to write in C++ but got stuck at the **very end** because I tried to mix Asio, async, class inheritance and multithreading. Surely I had written absolute spaghetti code laced with memory leaks.
